# Encryption
------------

File encryption transforms data into code that only intended recipients can decipher, preventing unauthorized users from being able to access, view, and understand sensitive information.

It offers a higher security as each file has its on own encryption key, protecting confidential information and ensure that your files remain safe.

The algorithm used in this encryption is XOR cipher for now, ill implement AES soon.
